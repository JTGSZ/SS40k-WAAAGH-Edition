/*
	Basically below is the procedural generation datum.

/* 
You may ask, why would we handle it this way?
Well the answer is that we need the coordinates of certain things to build off each other.
When I do it via just using global procs, it works yes, but what if I need,
Information from one of the procedures? I'd have to pass it somewhere, so we might as well hold
All the information I need in a datum. As for why its in this folder now? Mostly so Its relicensed,
And so I can find it easily.

As for the plan here, we will do things in stages like before except now we can use information!.
Heres a rough outline relevant as of 4/27/2020. The stages are basically markers of the steps
Of the old way.
Appends are what we can do using information saved in the datum/other thoughts.

Stage 1 - We generate random templates
Append - We can run through and place objective objects.
Stage 2 - We generate the Spawns
Append - We can now generate a town
Append - We can now place objective items/add them to the global list.
Stage 3 - We generate rivers/lakes
Append - We can now place roads.
Stage 4 - We do cleanup and detailing
Stage 5 - We load all the flora in.
Append - We load in some Fauna
