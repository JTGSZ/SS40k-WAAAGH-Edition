//Map Scenario Controller, basically keeps track of shit like a datum cause it is one.
//Also handles timing on traps that are tied into its lists.
//I had it on something that was purely a datum, but we were running into issues.
//So here we are with a subsystem now, seeing these globals probably will make people scream.
//But idc bitches

/*
	Future Design Goals
*/
/*
	Add controller Datums, let people assign the max interval possible on them.
	Let them assign traps to numbers on it and auto calculate the tick of stuff.
	EX: They set it to 10. We iterate to 10, so the max length has user input.
	They can make multiple controller datums.
	Its basically like a machine circuit controller that just ticks up.
	Perhaps we can allow multiplication etc.
	We will use this subsystem to keep timing on all of them, and also hold them
	When that day comes at least.
