C. Then when the object they are using calls attack, it runs this and then runs the overwritten thing.
Doing a special attack at the end of the proc chain based on whats in the last_attacks string holder.
------------------Design Decisions---------------------
Stance actions will add to the string holder.
A specific string will be a universal buffer clear

Todo:
And, I need a way to control force, effects on segments of the body.
Along with that I need a way to handle armor piercing and such too.
