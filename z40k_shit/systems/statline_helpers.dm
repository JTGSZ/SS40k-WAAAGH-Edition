//Yes, we have stats. Strength doesn't do much atm.
//It also helps me do some inhand objects that are large with awkward positions.
//Its mostly stat_strength because theres too many vars in the codebase that are already named strength.
//What I will do is I will make the probability proc and everything here, mostly so.
//There is a central location to train up the stat itself.

//The closer we get to the maximum cap the lower the probability modifier gets.
//After that we will swap to a static value before it unlocks a probability modifier for the next tier.
