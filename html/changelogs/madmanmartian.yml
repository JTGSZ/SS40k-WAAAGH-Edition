# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.  Do not use capitalization.
delete-after: true

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# There needs to be a space after the - and before the prefix. Don't use tabs anywhere in this file.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# If you're using characters such as # ' : - or the like in your changelog, surround the entire change with quotes as shown in the second example. These quotes don't show up on the changelog once it's merged and prevent errors.
# SCREW ANY OF THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
changes: 
- rscadd: Cryogenic tubes have now been reworked.
- tweak: Cryogenics no longer passively heal brute, burn, oxygen deprivation, and toxin damage for free.
- tweak: Cryogenics no longer duplicate chems put within them.
- rscadd: The beaker placed within the cryo tube now steadily injects reagents into the tube itself, which are transferred to the occupant through touch. If the occupant is wearing impermeable clothing, they will not be consumed.
- tweak: Cryo now consumes power.
- rscadd: Upgrading the internal components of cryo now enables different abilities and increases active power consumption. Tier 2 scanning modules enables the ability to tweak injection rate, maximum injection rate depending on manipulator tier, Tier 3 scanning modules enables the cryo being able to auto-eject occupants at full health. Tier 4 scanning modules means cryo no longer stuns the occupant.
